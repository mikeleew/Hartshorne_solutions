    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $Y$ be the plane curve $y = x^2$ (i.e., $Y$ is the zero set of the polynomial $f = y - x^2$). Show that $A(Y)$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $k$.

        \item  Let $Z$ be the plane curve $xy = 1$. Show that $A(Z)$ is not isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $k$.

        \item Let $f$ be any irreducible quadratic polynomial in $k[x,y]$, and let $W$ be the conic defined by $f$. Show that $A(W)$ is isomorphic to $A(Y)$ or $A(Z)$. Which one is it when?
