    Suppose that $H = Z(f)$ with $f$ irreducible in $k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$.  Then the projection of $f$ in $A(Y) := k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I(Y)$ is not equal to $\overline{0}$ since by assumption $(f) \not\subset I(Y)$.  Since $A(Y)$ is a domain (due to the irreducibility of $Y$), the element $\overline{f}$ is not a zero divisor.  Assuming that $Y \cap H \neq \varnothing$, we have that $\overline{f}$ is not a unit in $A(Y)$.  To see this, let $P \in Y \cap H$.  Then $I(Y), (f) \subset \mathfrak{m}_P$, the maximal ideal of $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ corresponding to $P$.  This implies $(\overline{f}) \subset \mathfrak{m}_P / I(Y)$, the latter being a maximal ideal in $A(Y)$.  Thus, $\overline{f}$ is not a unit.

    We apply Theorem 1.11A to get that every minimal prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ in $A(Y)$ containing $\overline{f}$ has height 1.  The irreducible components of $Y \cap H$ and the minimal prime ideals containing $(\overline{f})$ correspond, and since each of these prime ideals has height 1, the corresponding varieties have dimension $r-1$ by Theorem 1.8A.
