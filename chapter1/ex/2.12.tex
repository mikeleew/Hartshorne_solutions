	{\em The $d$-{\rm Uple} Embedding}.  For given $n, d >0$, let $M_0, M_1, \ldots, M_N$ be all the monomials of degree $d$ in the $n+1$ variables $x_0, \ldots, x_n$, where $N = {n+d \choose n} - 1$.  We define a mapping $\rho_d \colon \mathbb{P}^n \to \mathbb{P}^N$ by sending the point $P = (a_0, \ldots, a_n)$ to the point $\rho_d(P) = (M_0(a), \ldots, M_N(a))$ obtained by substituting the $a_i$ in the monomials $M_j$.  This is called the {\em $d$-{\rm uple} embedding} of $\mathbb{P}^n$ in $\mathbb{P}^N$.  For example, if $n=1,d=2$, then $N=2$, and the image $Y$ of the 2-uple embedding of $\mathbb{P}^1$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ is a conic.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Let $\theta \colon k[y_0, \ldots, y_N] \to k[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$ be the homomorphism defined by sending $y_i$ to $M_i$, and let $\mathfrak{a}$ be the kernel of $\theta$.  Then $\mathfrak{a}$ is a homogeneous prime ideal, and so $Z(\mathfrak{a})$ is a projective variety in $\mathbb{P}^N$.
	\item Show that the image of $\rho_d$ is exactly $Z(\mathfrak{a})$.  (One inclusion is easy.  The other will require some calculation.)
	\item Now show that $\rho_d$ is a homeomorphism of $\mathbb{P}^n$ onto the projective variety $Z(\mathfrak{a})$.
	\item Show  that the twisted cubic curve in $\mathbb{P}^3$ (Ex. 2.9) is equal to the 3-uple embedding of $\mathbb{P}^1$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$, for suitable choice of coordinates.
