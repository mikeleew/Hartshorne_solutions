\begin{enumerate}
    \item There is a 1-1 inclusion-reversing correspondence between algebraic sets in $\P^n$, and homogeneous radical ideals of $S$ not equal to $S_+$, given by $Y \mapsto I(Y)$ and $J \mapsto Z(J)$. [\emph{Note:} Since $S_+$ does not occur in this correspondence, it is sometimes called the \emph{irrelevant} maximal ideal of $S$.]
    \item An algebraic set $Y \subseteq \P^n$ is irreducible if and only if $I(Y)$ is a prime ideal.
    \item Show that $\P^n$ itself is irreducible.
\end{enumerate}
