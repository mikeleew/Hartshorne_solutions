\begin{enumerate}
    \item For any morphism of sheaves $\phi: \mathscr{F}\to\mathscr{G}$, show that for each point $P$, $(\ker \phi )_{P}=\ker(\phi_{P})$ and $(\operatorname{im}\phi)_{P} = \operatorname{im}(\phi_{P})$.
    \item Show that $\phi$ is injective (surjective) iff induced map on stalks $\phi_{P}$ is injective (surjective) for all $P$.
    \item Show that the sequence of sheaves $\begin{tikzcd}[cramped, sep=small] \cdots \arrow[r] & \mathscr{F}^{i-1} \arrow[r] & \mathscr{F}^{i} \arrow[r] & \mathscr{F}^{i+1} \arrow[r] & \cdots \end{tikzcd}$ is exact iff coresponding sequences of stalks are exact for all $P$.
